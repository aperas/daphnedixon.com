Welcome to GreenTowns:
A Growing National Network of 15,000 Sustainable Communities

GreenTowns is a national network that connects and celebrates local green initiatives, their leaders and the sustainable communities we are all striving to create. It brings together successful sustainability efforts at the local level, presents these initiatives by town and by category, and invites people to share their expertise and experiences.

In this way, GreenTowns makes it easy to:

Discover inspiring green initiatives – Find (and share) successful approaches to sustainability in your backyard, or 2000 miles away, and connect with the people behind them.
Share your questions, expertise & support – Use GreenTowns to share your knowledge on a green topic, help others replicate a successful initiative or learn from each other. Be a voice for sustainability in your community or simply offer an encouraging word to others.
Help grow sustainable communities – Get more impact from all our green efforts by connecting with each other. We each have a role to play as part of the "local infrastructure" of initiatives, expertise and human connections needed to make each town greener.
How Green is Your Town?
AN INVITATION TO PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA
to share and support sustainable efforts going on in your community

Across 15,000 community networks, people are sharing their green initiatives locally, and connecting with other communities nationally, creating a sustainability network. The role of the GreenTowns network, is to support these connections with tools that facilitate sharing information and resources throughout the country.
Learn more about sustainability efforts in your town and how to participate locally.
